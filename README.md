# WeatherApp

 A React JS weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API. I use fetchapi to connect with our API. There are probably serveral ways to create a weather app and this is  a very basic level weather app where you can learn the basic of ReactJs.
 In this app you just need to write location name in the search bar and then it within seconds it will tell you about temperature,humidity and wind speed of that location.
